# Daedalus-Tabula


Daedalus Tabula is my attempt at creating the much anticipated DPS Website. This is created using Blazor in the .Net Framework. So if you want to contribute please refer to the Blazor documentation.

The project has two parts. One is Daedalus Tabula which is the actual website based on Blazor. The second is Daedalus Orbis. Daedalus Orbis contains any game mechanics as well as any alogrithms associated with that and the used database models. Anything related to game mechanics goes into Daedalus Orbis and anything related to UI goes into Daedalus Tabula. Under no circumstance should Daedalus Orbis contain Blazor elements.
